# About 
I am a third year statistics PhD student at Stanford, advised by [Emmanuel Candès](https://candes.su.domains/). My research interests span multiple testing, inference for adaptively collected data, and causal inference. I am supported by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Before the PhD, I graduated with an A.B. in statistics & math and an S.M. in computer science from Harvard. During undergrad, I was lucky to be advised by [Lucas Janson](https://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/) and to work with [Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Nan Jiang](https://nanjiang.cs.illinois.edu/).
